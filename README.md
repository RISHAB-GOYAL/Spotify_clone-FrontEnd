# Spotify_clone-FrontEnd
Spotify Clone is a simple web project built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the basic UI of Spotify, including a navigation bar, playlist section, and a music player interface. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. This project is purely front-end and does not include backend functionality or actual music playback.
